1.  stdint.h provides a set of typedefs that specify the exact widths
    of integer types. 

2.  using the different bit widths we can exactly align to the format of
    the bitmap file strucutre

3.  BYTE    = 8 bits
    DWORD   = 32-bit unsigned integer  
    LONG    = 32-bit signed integer
    WORD    = 16-but unsigned integer

4.  the first two bytes of a bmp file is the bfType, must be BM

5.  bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file. biSize is the size
    of the bit map info header (biSize is contant 40 bytes)

6.  if biHeight is negative the bitmpa is a top-down bitmap with
    the origin at the top left. If postive then origin is at the 
    lower left corner.

7.  biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel.

8.  Upon success fopen() returns a FILE pointer, otherwise NULL is
    returned

9.  The third argument to fread() is one becasue we only want to
    read once the size specified in the second argument.

10. Line 65 in copy.c assigns 3 to the variable padding

11. fseek() function sets the file position for the stream pointed
    to by the stream.

12. when SEEK_CUR is set, the offset is relative to the 
    current position indicator.
